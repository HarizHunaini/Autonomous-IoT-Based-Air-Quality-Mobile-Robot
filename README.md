# Autonomous-IoT-Based-Air-Quality-Mobile-Robot
Develop an autonomous mobile robot to monitor and report real-time air quality, helping to address environmental and health concerns. The robot will use an ultrasonic sensor to detect and avoid obstacles while navigating. It will be equipped with IoT capabilities using Arduino Cloud to wirelessly communicate air quality data.
